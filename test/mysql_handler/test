This script detects if you're in "dev" mode by the existence of
the secretless-dev container.  That container will exist only if
the development process was started using the "./dev" command.

If in dev mode, all tests will be run against the "secretless-dev"
container, which will not be torn down.  If not, they will be run
in a fresh test container which will be torn down afterward.

Options:
  -v verbose mode; provides more verbose output for test cases
