## Instructions

{{- if .Values.csrEnabled }}
Before you can proceed to use the sidecar-injector, there's one last step.
You will need to approve the CSR (Certificate Signing Request) made by the sidecar-injector.
This allows the sidecar-injector to communicate securely with the Kubernetes API.

### Watch initContainer logs for when CSR is created
kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} logs deployment/{{ include "cyberark-sidecar-injector.fullname" . }} -c init-webhook -f

### You can check and inspect the CSR
kubectl describe csr "{{ include "cyberark-sidecar-injector.fullname" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}"

### Approve the CSR
kubectl certificate approve "{{ include "cyberark-sidecar-injector.fullname" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}"
{{- end }}

Now that everything is setup you can enjoy the Cyberark Sidecar Injector.
This is the general workflow:

1. Annotate your application to enable the injector and to configure the sidecar (see README.md)
2. Webhook intercepts and injects containers as needed

Enjoy.
