CyberArk is incredibly pleased to announce the beta release of a new open source project, Secretless Broker. Secretless Broker makes secrets management seamless for developers by removing secrets from the application space so that applications built with Secretless Broker are leak-proof.

Secretless Broker runs as a separate local process and automatically handles authentication to the protected resources your application needs. It can be configured with any secrets provider to inject credentials for connection requests as needed - no application code changes required. Secretless Broker won’t log your passwords anywhere – and neither will your application (it can’t)!
