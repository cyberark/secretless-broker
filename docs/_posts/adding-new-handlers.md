excerpt: "Using Secretless Broker's Built-In Plugin Architecture to Add Features"
---

Secretless Broker has [documentation](/generated/pkg_secretless_plugin_v1.html)
on its plugin architecture, but to make it as easy as possible to contribute
new functionality we'll spend some time in this blog post breaking down how to
contribute support for a new Target Service.

In our [reference](/docs/overview/how_it_works.html), we break down how the
Secretless Broker internal architecture handles incoming requests. Every target
service that Secretless Broker natively supports has its own Listener and Handler
implemented in the Secretless internals.

  - The Listener listens on a TCP port or Unix socket for incoming connections,
    and forwards them to the Handler
  - The Handler uses standard functionality to retrieve the credentials it needs
    and opens a connection to the Target Service with those credentials injected
  - The Handler streams the connection

In what follows, we'll walk through the steps you would take to add a new
Listener/Handler pair to the Secretless project. We'll focus on adding it to the
project internals, but at the end we'll briefly give some guidance for how to build an
external plugin into the broker binary.

# Adding a New Listener

The first step in adding support to Secretless Broker for your service is to add
a `newservice` folder to the [/internal/app/secretless/listeners/](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker/tree/master/internal/app/secretless/listeners)
directory. In that directory you'll create a file `listener.go` that has to
implement
