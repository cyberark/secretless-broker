# On CyberArk dev laptops, golang module dependencies are downloaded with a

# configure the proxy CA certificate in build containers.
#
# To allow this script to also work on non-CyberArk laptops where the CA
# certificate is not available, we copy the (potentially empty) directory
# and update container certificates based on that, rather than rely on the
# CA file itself.
