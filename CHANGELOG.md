# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.7.3] - 2020-03-04
### Changed
- Update k8s authenticator client version to
  [0.19.1](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-authn-k8s-client/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0191---2021-02-08),
  which streamlines the parsing of authentication responses, updates the
  project Golang version to v1.15, and improves error messaging.

### Fixed
- Secretless now sends a valid "SSL is not supported" response per the
  PostgreSQL protocol standard when a client attempts to open an SSL connection
  (i.e. when configured with SSL mode `require` or `prefer`) via the PostgreSQL
  connector. When the client is configured with SSL mode `prefer`, the updated
  response enables the client to downgrade to an insecure connection and
  continue. Previously, clients sending requests using either `require` or
  `prefer` SSL mode would receive a generic error from Secretless, which made it
  harder to determine the root cause of the problem and broke how `prefer` is
  expected to work.
  [cyberark/secretless-broker#1377](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker/issues/1377)

## [1.7.2] - 2020-02-05

### Added
- Support for OpenShift 4.3 and 4.5.
  [conjurdemos/kubernetes-conjur-demo#122](https://github.com/conjurdemos/kubernetes-conjur-demo/issues/122)

### Deprecated
- Support for OpenShift 3.9 and 3.10 is removed in this release.
  [conjurdemos/kubernetes-conjur-demo#122](https://github.com/conjurdemos/kubernetes-conjur-demo/issues/122)

### Fixed
- Automatic endpoint discovery for the AWS connector was updated to address two
  bugs where (1) the request host header was not being updated to the discovered
  endpoint, and (2) the request modification was being done after signing the
  request which would result in a failing integrity check.
  [cyberark/secretless-broker#1369](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker/issues/1369)

## [1.7.1] - 2020-10-20

### Added
- The `vault` provider now supports loading secrets from the KV Version 2 secret
  engine. Reference a secret in Vault using the right path and a field
  navigation in the Secretless configuration.
  [cyberark/secretless-broker#1331](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker/issues/1331)

### Changed
- Update k8s authenticator client version to
  [0.19.0](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-authn-k8s-client/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0190---2020-10-08),
  which adds some fixes around cert injection failure (see also changes in
  [0.18.1](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-authn-k8s-client/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0181---2020-09-13)).
  [cyberark/secretless-broker#1352](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker/pull/1352)

## [1.7.0] - 2020-09-11

### Added
- Secretless and secretless-redhat containers now use Alpine 3.12 as their base
  image. [PR cyberark/secretless-broker#1296](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker/pull/1296)
- MySQL and PostgreSQL connectors support SSL host name verification with
  `verify-full` SSL mode. Also adds optional `sslhost` configuration parameter
  that is compared to the server's certificate SAN.
  [cyberark/secretless-broker#548](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker/issues/548)
- Generic HTTP connector now supports `queryParam` as a configurable section
  in the Secretless configuration file, under `config`. This allows the
  construction of a query string which can have credentials injected
  as needed.
  [cyberark/secretless-broker#1290](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker/issues/1290)
- Generic HTTP connector now supports `oauth1` as a configurable section in the
  secretless configuration file, under `config`. This allows the construction of
  a header for an OAuth 1.0 request. The OAuth 1.0 feature currently only supports
  HMAC-SHA1, but there is an [issue](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker/issues/1324)
  logged to support other hashing methods.
  [cyberark/secretless-broker#1297](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker/issues/1297)
- Many (20+) example generic connector configurations were added to the project,
  to demonstrate support for a broad set of popular APIs and to serve as an
  example for other APIs users may need to use Secretless with their apps.
  See [here](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker/tree/master/examples/generic_connector_configs)
  for the full list of examples.
  [cyberark/secretless-broker#1248](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker/issues/1248)

## [1.6.0] - 2020-05-04

### Added
- Support for a `SECRETLESS_HTTP_CA_BUNDLE` environment variable that specifies
  the path to a CA cert bundle and enables users to configure Secretless with
  additional CA certificates for server cert verification when using HTTP
  connectors.
  [PR #1180](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker/pull/1180)
- TLS support for the Secretless-to-server connections of the MSSQL connector.
  This is the recommended way to secure this connection and achieves feature
  parity with other TLS connectors.
  [#1163](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker/issues/1163),
  [#1164](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker/issues/1164),
  [#1165](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker/issues/1165)
- MSSQL connector supports SSL host name verification with `verify-full` SSL
  mode. Also adds optional `sslhost` configuration parameter that is compared to
  the server's certificate SAN.
  [#1199](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker/issues/1199)

### Fixed
- PostgreSQL connector log messages were updated to improve formatting, fixing
  a previous issue where the log messages were improperly formatted and were
  garbled in the logs. [PR #1192](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker/pull/1192)

### Security
- TCP connectors all automatically zeroize the connection credentials in memory
  after successfully opening a connection; previously, credentials were only
  zeroized in memory on error. [#1188](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker/issues/1188)
