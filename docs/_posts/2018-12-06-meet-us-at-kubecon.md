The CyberArk development team responsible for the Secretless Broker project is excited
to be traveling to KubeCon in Seattle next week! CyberArk is a proud sponsor of KubeCon
North America 2018 from December 10 to December 13. CyberArk will also be
sponsoring the Red Hat OpenShift Commons Gathering co-located with KubeCon on 12/10. 
In addition, this year KubeCon is sharing space with KubeSec Enterprise Summit 2018 where
our own Geri Jennings, CyberArk Software Engineer and Secretless Broker developer,
will be speaking.

Please stop by to chat with our engineers and representatives
at any of these events and learn more about the Secretless Broker project. Feel free to reach
out to us on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/secretless)
if you have any questions.

You can find someone from the Secretless Broker engineering team at the CyberArk
booth <strong>S75</strong> throughout the conference.
