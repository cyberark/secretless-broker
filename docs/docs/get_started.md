# Get Started

To get started trying out Secretless, you can run through our [quick start demos](/docs/get_started/quick_start.html)
that allow you to try it out with PostgreSQL, SSH, or an HTTP web service.

If you are looking for a more detailed introduction to how Secretless works in
practice, please look at our introduction to [deploying to Kubernetes](/docs/get_started/deploy_to_kubernetes.html).

Secretless is currently in **alpha**, which means that it's suitable for demo and evaluation
purposes.
